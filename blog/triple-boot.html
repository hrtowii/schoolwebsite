        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>During my June holidays in 2021, I managed to complete my goal of installing macOS, Windows, and Linux on the
            same machine. </p>
        <h2>What's the point of doing so?</h2>
        <p>Initially, I wanted to install Linux and Windows together just to try it. However after some time, I
            preferred to
            use Linux over windows for normal usage. I'd always notice that my system ran much smoother and without
            stutters
            on Arch (i use arch btw) whereas Windows sometimes would keep my laptop hot and noisy even on a fresh
            install.
            Furthermore, I was much more comfortable using the terminal on Linux as compared to Powershell/cmd on
            Windows.
            Having an easy to use package manager (pacman/yay/paru/yaourt) to install whatever I wanted using the Arch
            User
            Repository (AUR) instead of trawling through Google for install links was the icing on the cake for me.</p>
        <p>I couldn't outright just ditch Windows though, as I needed it to play games that aren't compatible with
            proton/WINE due to anticheat compatibility. Examples of such games were Genshin Impact and VALORANT. </p>
        <p>Well, so that settles why I wanted to use Linux. How about macOS? After all, both Linux and macOS are
            UNIX(-like), so there shouldn't be any difference in those two operating systems for programming. The main
            difference for me was the UI. Cheesy, I know, but I recently had the chance to use my dad's 2013 MacBook
            Pro.
            After using it for around 2 weeks, I had grown accustomed and even found myself growing fond of it moreso
            than
            using Linux at times. These aren't really valid reasons though, aren't they? I was just bored during the
            holidays
            with nothing to do, so I decided to waste my time installing macOS onto my system.</p>
        <h2>Installing Linux</h2>
        <h3>Selecting a distro</h3>
        <p>Before I installed Linux, I was a Windows only user which had previously installed WSL to learn basic
            terminal
            commands. After some Googling, I managed to shortlist my choices to 3 distros: Fedora, Ubuntu, or Arch
            Linux. I
            flashed an ISO of each distro to my thumbdrive and livebooted each of them to try which of them were my
            favourite.
            // complete later</p>
        <h2>Installing macOS</h2>
        <h3>Smooth sailing?</h3>
        <p>Researching the internet for information about Hackintosh revealed that there were multiple methods for me to
            choose from in order to install macOS on my laptop. OpenCore, Clover, "flavors" of macOS which offered
            prebuilt
            EFIs... left me spoilt for choice. However, reading more Reddit threads about installing Big Sur on my
            laptop
            showed that OpenCore was the way to go. Conveniently, OpenCore also has a <a
                href="https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/">guide</a> which was easy for me to follow.</p>
        <p>Great! I could follow the guide for my laptop, which had a Kaby Lake CPU and UHD620 iGPU graphics, and create
            an
            EFI with OpenCore to install macOS on.</p>
        <h3>Problems faced when installing</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>WiFi + Bluetooth incompatibility</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>macOS is a picky operating system. As it only needs to support a limited number of laptops and
                        iMacs, each
                        with specified hardware, I was bound to have <em>some</em> sort of incompatible hardware. As
                        Apple macOS
                        devices all contain Broadcom WiFi cards, macOS only supports WiFi and Bluetooth for those WiFi
                        cards.</li>
                    <li>Unfortunately, my laptop contained a Qualcomm Atheros QC6174a Wireless Network Adapter. Bummer.
                    </li>
                    <li>This meant that I wasn't able to connect to the internet or use bluetooth at ALL, which
                        prevented me from
                        using the online macOS installer to install to my laptop. My laptop didn't have an ethernet port
                        either, so
                        I couldn't go down that path. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>NVIDIA (Optimus) being unsupported</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>My laptop contained both integrated graphics and a dedicated NVIDIA GPU to switch between at any
                        given
                        time. This was a cool feature on my other operating systems, as I was able to save some battery
                        life when I
                        wasn't doing anything graphically intensive.</li>
                    <li>However, Mac(book)s no longer have any new NVIDIA GPUs, and so macOS doesn't really support them
                        anymore.
                        Hence, the latest GPU that can be supported for NVIDIA are the Maxwell and Pascal generations up
                        to High
                        Sierra. Kepler(v2) GPUs are supported up to the latest version of Big Sur.</li>
                    <li>On the other hand, many AMD graphics cards are still well supported up to the current version of
                        macOS.
                    </li>
                    <li>As my laptop's discrete graphics card was unsupported, I had to disable it and rely on
                        integrated graphics
                        to work. This brings me to my next point:</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>iGPU not working initially</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In my rush to quickly install macOS, I messed up in configuring my EFI for OpenCore such that I
                        was not
                        able to use my integrated graphics properly. </li>
                    <li>It was such a PITA that I decided to trash everything and start from the top again.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Sound codec not working without Codeccommander</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Audio is broke OOTB for Hackintoshes. The easiest way to solve this normally is to follow the
                        OpenCore
                        guide to try multiple possible layout IDs for your audio codec.</li>
                    <li>After trial-and-error, I stumbled open a layout ID that played sound correctly, but was weirdly
                        tinny on
                        both headphones and speakers. Confused, I tried other audio codec's layout IDs, but to no avail
                        either.</li>
                    <li>I eventually had to use Google to check out what I was doing wrong, but it was just a known
                        issue with
                        certain audio codecs, and I had to<a

                            install some software </a> to fix it.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Working around problems</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Buying a WiFi adapter<ul>
                    <li>After some intense ~~googling~~ research, I came to the conclusion that I had to use the offline
                        macOS
                        installer, then use a external wireless adapter (those USB wifi sticks) and install drivers to
                        enable WiFi
                        for my laptop.</li>
                    <li>This still did not restore Bluetooth functionality, which meant I could not use my wireless mice
                        or
                        keyboard.</li>
                    <li>It was a painstaking 2 weeks of waiting for my wireless adapter to arrive before I could proceed
                        with
                        installing macOS on my laptop.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Compatibility issues between OSes</h2>
        <h3>Bootloader problems</h3>
        <p>Previously on my dual boot, I used REFInd as a bootloader to select between the Windows and Linux EFI
            partitions,
            as they were each on separate drives. I'd heard of horror stories where Windows updates would wipe the Linux
            bootloader if they were both installed on the same drive.</p>
        <p>However, OpenCore is also a bootloader, which meant I had to either get rid of REFInd and use OpenCore to
            boot
            each OS directly, or chainload to REFInd when I wanted to boot either Windows or Linux.</p>
