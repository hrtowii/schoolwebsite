        <h1 class="gradient">Theming iOS Control Center modules on iOS 11 and above with CAML</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In iOS 11, Apple totally revamped the Control Center to become more modular and clean. Ever since then, it
            was
            thought that theming the icon modules were almost impossible, as they were written in a weird file format:
            CAML.
            Workarounds for this through jailbreak tweaks were made by creating entirely separate icon modules that
            contained
            just static pngs (flipswitch/flipconvert). This is fine, but the only exception to this are the sliders. It
            was
            mostly thought to be impossible to theme those by the theming community until now.</p>
        <h2>Wtf is CAML?</h2>
        <p>Huge thanks to iOSCreatix for his medium post. Read this article if you want to understand more. His maize
            repository on Github (<a
                href="https://github.com/andrewwiik/Maize/tree/master/Modules">https://github.com/andrewwiik/Maize/tree/master/Modules</a>)
            also contains many examples of CAML files that I used to understand it.</p>
        <p>Essentially, CAML is a xml kind of file that describes how a particular CC module is drawn, and uses
            CoreGraphics/CoreAnimation. Although the API for CAML is private, CoreAnimation documentation is public on
            Apple’s
            website here: <a
                href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore</a>
        </p>
        <h2>Using CAML to theme icons?</h2>
        <p>Some icons use assets from the <code>Assets.car</code></a> in their directory, but
            most animated icons use CAShapeLayers. The most interesting property of this is <code>path</code>, which is
            a
            CGPath. CGPaths are something similar to SVGs, so they can be scaled up or down without losing quality.
            There
            are
            two ways of theming this, one of which i’ve tried and failed: Replacing CAShapeLayer with a regular CALayer
            and
            adding a normal PNG, or converting your image into a CGPath that can be drawn.</p>
        <h2>Using normal images</h2>
        <p><a
                href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore/calayer/1410773-contents">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore/calayer/1410773-contents</a>
        </p>
        <p>CALayer has a property &lt;contents&gt; that accepts an image and places it on the CC slider. It would have
            been
            perfect for my use case until I tried it and… it looked horrible.</p>
        <p>&#x200B;</p>
        <div class="centered"><img src="../img/img5.webp"></img></div>
        <p>This isn’t an issue if you’re using a solid 1square png or something. But most of the time you aren’t, which
            brings me to the second method:</p>
        <h2>Converting images to CGPaths</h2>
        <p>If you look at the medium post from above, you may have seen something interesting in the CAShapeLayer:</p>
        <img src="../img/img4.webp"></img>
        <p>The <code>path</code> property draws an image on the layer using CGPath. Sounds similar to SVGs. How do you
            convert a PNG to something that can be converted to CGPath? Well firstly, you’d need to convert it to a SVG
            image
            first. Use <a href="https://photopea.com">https://photopea.com</a> to do so. Find an app (Paintcode) or (<a
                href="http://svg-converter.kyome.io/">http://svg-converter.kyome.io/</a>) that converts SVG images into
            UIBezierPaths for Apple. These have a property that prints the CGPath of the image:</p>
        <div class="centered"><img src="../img/img3.webp"></img></div>
        <p>I couldn’t figure out how to do this with normal swift without creating an xcode app project. I’m not a swift
            dev
            :sadge:. Paste the UIBezierPath code generated by your app, remove context, then print the path’s
            <code>.cgPath</code> to find the string needed to draw your desired image. Note that you may need multiple
            CAShapeLayers if you want different opacities for different parts of the image. Now, you can copy any image
            that
            you’d like and convert it into a CC module. Pretty cool. But there’s obviously more to this than just having
            a
            static image on your sliders. How they are animated is by using LKState/CAState. I still do not fully
            understand
            them, but the Medium post i linked above does a fairly good job at explaining them.
        </p>

            <div class="contentright">
                <img src="../img/img2.webp"></img>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>I hope that this post has brought more insight to the CAML format and how they can be used by you to theme
            any
            Control Center module with a jailbreak/MacDirtyCow (MDC probably won’t work with animations, as the modified
            file
            needs to be smaller or the same size as the original).</p>
