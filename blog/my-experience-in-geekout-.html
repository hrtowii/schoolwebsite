        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>I was given the opportunity to join the yearly GeekOut bootcamp/hackathon event organised by GovTech during
            my
            June holidays. I wasn't sure what to expect from the event and was initially nervous, but I had a truly
            eye-opening and fulfilling experience there and I learnt a lot about the recent innovations in GovTech that
            are
            helping Singapore become a smart nation. Not only that, but I also made many friends and gained valuable
            insights into different tech fields such as fullstack, cybersec, data science and Unity through the
            workshops
            and talks at GeekOut over the course of five days.</p>
        <h2>Meeting new people</h2>
        <p>On the first day of the bootcamp, I was introduced to my group members (Euan, Jun Jie, Shriya, Su Hui, Wei
            Jie)
            and our mentor Jasmine. Through the ice-breaker games, we warmed up to each other more and got to know more
            about everyone. In fact, it was kind of cool how each of us had their own background and strengths; some of
            us
            didn't have any coding background at all! Having a diverse range of strengths, not just limited to technical
            skills, was really helpful in balancing the team.</p>
        <p>During lunch, I walked around the room and introduced myself to other participants and GovTech employees. It
            was
            immediately obvious to me that almost all of them were older than me which was a little intimidating.
            However,
            talking to them and getting to know more about them eased my anxiety and helped me get to know them better.
            By
            the end of the first day, I'd loosened up a little and had warmed up to everyone around me.</p>
        <h2>Workshops</h2>
        <p>The workshops and talks that GovTech organised for us to go through throughout the course of the bootcamp
            were
            all really interesting and let me dip my toes in many fields in the tech industry.
            We got the chance to learn how Unity is used to create apps for digital twin technology in Singapore, how
            Figma,
            React, and Node can be used to create full stack applications, and how Google Colab could be used to run ML
            models online. </p>
        <p>One aspect of tech that I've never really touched before was Cybersec. Through the talk by Jervin and
            Pengfei, I
            got to learn more about how red, blue, and purple teaming worked. I also learnt about how a Kubernetes
            master
            node could potentially be hacked, and how app obfuscation can be used both defensively (effectively
            balancing
            speed/size while maintaining as much security as possible) and offensively (crashing decompilers of those
            who
            try to reverse engineer how an app works). </p>
        <p>Of course, every workshop was eye opening and I gained many new insights from this, even from stuff that I've
            learnt before on my own.</p>
        <h2>Hackathon</h2>
        <p>On the 4th day of the bootcamp, we were briefed about our hackathon problem statement and tasked to develop a
            solution to tackle it:</p>
        <h3>Develop a smart city solution to improve quality of life for citizens while also enhancing the
            sustainability of
            the goal to move towards a smarter nation.</h3>
        <p>We were given Thursday 12pm until Friday 11:30am to work on our solution, and had to submit it by 11:30am on
            Friday. It was quite a tight timeframe, especially because the space we were working at would close by 7pm.
        </p>
        <p>What the guidelines of the hackathon were essentially:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The solution designed should be accessible and user-friendly to citizens of all-ages, background and
            technical
            abilities.
            <li>It’s highly encouraged to leverage existing datasets and APIs provided by the Government but are not
            limited
            to.
            <li>Solutions are not limited to web or mobile applications. Prototypes done using figma, google slides or
            canva
            are fine as well.</ul>
        <p>The submission format only needed us to upload slides to fulfil its requirements. Although technical
            execution
            was also taken into account, I feel that the hackathon mainly sought good ideas that addressed the problem,
            demonstrated a solid understanding of it, and effectively used technology to provide a solution. </p>
        <p>The thing about being in a government-organised hackathon is that there would usually be more policies
            involved
            instead of building whatever cool shit you come up with. We tried to follow as closely as possible to the
            theme
            of building something nation-wide for citizens that is also a smart city solution, and spent the afternoon
            of
            the first day throwing out ideas and seeing what stuck. We had a few false starts, such as Sustainability365
            and
            a navigation app for the blind. </p>
        <p>In the end, we came up with an idea of a centralised lecture platform / learning management system for JC
            students. If you've heard about Holy Grail before, imagine that but for lectures. If you haven't, it's
            essentially a learning platform containing A-Level video lectures compiled and created by a group of
            teachers
            that are selected from every JC by MOE to do so every time the syllabus is updated. </p>
        <h2>Suffering at night</h2>
        <p>So we've come up with an idea. Now comes the time for us to create it; bring it to life. Since we only needed
            a
            slide deck (technically), we opted to not create the entire app because 1. only half the team knew how to
            code
            and 2. it would be much slower. Instead, we delegated tasks to each person based on their strengths; I did
            the
            Figma, Jun Jie created a Streamlit demo with CHATGPT, Euan created a video,</p>
        <p>One of the most valuable aspects of the GeekOut Bootcamp was the chance to engage directly with GovTech’s
            senior
            leaders during the fireside chat where they shared about how GovTech has used tech for public good. These
            sessions gave us a deeper understanding of the diverse tech domains within GovTech, such as cybersecurity,
            data
            science and artificial intelligence, and how they come together to address pressing societal challenges.</p>
        <h2>AMA</h2>
        <p>After the hackathon, we were given the chance to talk directly with some of GovTech's employees through the
            Ask
            Me Anything (AMA) session, where we got to know more about the different tech domains in GovTech and how
            they're
            used together to address nation-wide issues and build tech for public good (i feel like that's their
            catchphrase). One thing that I was curious about was how working in the public sector was different from
            working
            in private sector. (eg. was there a LOT of bureaucracy involved? how is the pay like? (i know very subtle)).
        </p>
        <p>All in all, I feel like I gained a lot more info about what working in the government was like, and how
            different
            government sectors had different styles of working.</p>
        <h2>Winning?!</h2>
        <p>After the AMA session had concluded, it was obviously time for the part everyone was waiting for the most:
            the
            announcements for who won. The winning categories were split into 3 parts:</p>
